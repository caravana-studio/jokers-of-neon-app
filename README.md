## React-app

Run the following commands to run the app:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You can find a .env file in the root of the project that has the default values to connect to a local instance of katana, torii and graphql.
Run the contracts before the frontend app.
